DREAMS - Experiments
========

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments of "DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction".

DREAMS combines the local structure preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a regularization term that motivates global structure preservation. It provides a continuum of embeddings along a local-global spectrum with almost no local/global structure preservation tradeoff.

The code depends on several repositories, especially on [openTSNE](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE) and [contrastive-ne](https://github.com/berenslab/contrastive-ne), which provide the $t$-SNE backends that DREAMS builds upon. The respective versions with additional regularizer are [DREAMS](https://github.com/berenslab/DREAMS) and [DREAMS-CNE](https://github.com/berenslab/DREAMS-CNE). The links to the original (unprocessed) datasets can be found further below.

# Installation

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/berenslab/dreams-experiments.git
cd dreams-experiments
```
Create a conda environment (we used Python 3.12.11):
````
conda create -n myenv python=3.12
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
Install openTSNE with regularizer (DREAMS):
````
git clone --branch tp --single-branch https://github.com/berenslab/DREAMS.git
cd DREAMS
python setup.py install
cd ..
````
and contrastive-ne with a regularizer (DREAMS-CNE)
````
git clone --branch tp --single-branch https://github.com/berenslab/DREAMS-CNE.git
cd DREAMS-CNE
pip install --no-deps .
cd ..
````
To perform the experiments, the datasets mentioned in the paper need to be downloaded from the links mentioned in the Datasets section further below, preprocessed as described in the paper and saved in the folder /data. The preprocessed Tasic et al. data set[^tasic] can already be found there.

To run our experiments of competing methods, first clone the [SQuadMDS](https://github.com/PierreLambert3/SQuaD-MDS-and-FItSNE-hybrid) and then run (Note: in the code we also compare against StarMAP[^starmap], whose code is as of this moment not publicly available):
````
python experiments/run_other_methods.py
python experiments/run_openTSNE_exag.py
````
To run the DREAMS experiments (Note: run_dreams_mds is using the MDS embedding from run_other_methods.py):
````
python experiments/run_dreams_pca.py
python experiments/run_dreams_mds.py
python experiments/run_dreams_cne.py
python experiments/tradeoff_other_methods.py
````
To analyze and plot the results use:
````
experiments/plot_results_paper.ipynb
````
Here all plots of the paper can be found.

# Datasets
In the experiments, we benchmarked DREAMS using seven real-world datasets that are preprocessed as decsribed in the paper. The preprocessed Tasic et al. data set[^tasic] can be found in the /data folder. The MNIST dataset was downloaded using the torchvision API (we only used the first 50 principle components of the 60k training samples). The remaining original datasets can be found here:
